# Tag Taxonomy

Controlled vocabulary for the wiki. The current corpus is **UAP-archives** focused (105 pages from 14 declassified-document ingests, 1944–2026). Tags below are organized by axis. Use this file as the source of truth before adding tags to any new page.

## Rules

- **Max 5 domain/type tags per page.** `visibility/` tags are system tags and do not count.
- **Lowercase, hyphenated.** `papua-new-guinea`, not `Papua New Guinea` or `papua_new_guinea`.
- **ASCII only.** No diacritics in tags. (Use diacritics in `title:` and body text.)
- **Singular by default.** `concept` not `concepts`; `entity` not `entities`. Exceptions: collective nouns where plural is the natural form (`balls-of-fire`, `flying-discs`).
- **Prefer broad over narrow.** A page about a specific NASA mission gets `nasa`, `mission` — not a per-mission tag.
- **Use category to disambiguate.** A page in `entities/` doesn't need an `entity` tag.
- **Never alias.** Pick the canonical form below.

## Reserved System Tags — `visibility/`

These mark a page's intended reach. **Optional.** Untagged pages default to public.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `visibility/public` | Explicitly public — same as no tag |
| `visibility/internal` | Team-only — excluded in filtered query/export mode |
| `visibility/pii` | Sensitive — excluded in filtered query/export mode |

Rules: do **not** count toward 5-tag limit; one per page; never aliased; leave untouched in audits.

Current corpus: **0 pages tagged**. All pages default to public, which matches an open-source declassified-archive vault.

## Domain Tags

The subject matter axis — what the page is about.

### Core domain

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `uap` | Anything in the UAP / unidentified-aerial-phenomena domain. The corpus's anchor tag (91 pages). |

### History / era

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `history` | Historical analysis or context (broad). |
| `ww2` | World War II (1939–1945) era specifically. |
| `1947` … `1994` | Year of source-event when narrowly anchored. Use sparingly — prefer `history` + `ww2` etc. when an era covers it. |
| `1960s` | Decade-level when year is unknown or pattern spans years. |

### Geography

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `france`, `georgia`, `germany`, `japan`, `kazakhstan`, `mexico`, `netherlands`, `papua-new-guinea`, `russia`, `sweden`, `tajikistan`, `turkmenistan`, `ussr` | Country of source-event or affiliation. (Note: `russia` for post-1991 Russian Federation; `ussr` for pre-1991 Soviet Union — keep both to preserve the political-era distinction.) |
| `alaska`, `arizona`, `california`, `idaho`, `kansas`, `kentucky`, `michigan`, `nevada`, `new-mexico`, `ohio`, `oregon`, `washington` | US state of source-event. Add when sighting/event is geographically anchored. |

### Institutional / agency

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `usaf` | US Air Force (post-1947). |
| `usaaf` | US Army Air Forces (1941–1947). |

| `nasc` | National Aeronautics and Space Council (EOP). |
| `fbi` | Federal Bureau of Investigation. |
| `state-department` | US Department of State. |
| `dod` | Department of Defense umbrella. |
| `eop` | Executive Office of the President. |
| `military` | Military domain at large (use when no more specific service tag fits, or for cross-service points). |
| `federal-le` | Federal law enforcement (FBI + other federal LE). Distinct from `fbi`-only items. |
| `foreign-government` | Non-US government as actor. |
| `civil-agency` | Civil (non-military) government agency. |
| `civilian-research` | Civilian (non-government) research orgs (e.g., OUFORA). |
| `intelligence` | Intelligence-community framing, sources, or methods. |
| `humint` | Human intelligence collection specifically. |
| `attache` | Defense / Air Attaché reporting channel. (No diacritic.) |
| `embassy` | US embassy as originating post. |
| `diplomacy` | Diplomatic (state-to-state) framing or channel. |

### Phenomenology

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `morphology` | Object form / shape signatures (discs, orbs, kites, cylinders). |
| `behavior` | Object behavioral signatures (pacing, suppression, formation flying). |
| `pattern` | Recurring cross-page pattern. |
| `orb` | Orb-class morphology. |
| `electromagnetic` | EM-effect signatures (engine stall, equipment fail). |

### Policy / institutional

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `policy` | Policy framings, doctrine, recommendations. |
| `protocol` | Specific reporting / observational protocols (e.g., Cabell 10-element template). |
| `institutional` | Institutional posture, framing, or behavior. |
| `contact` | First-contact / ETI policy framings. |
| `eti-attribution` | Pages where the extraterrestrial-intelligence attribution itself is the analytical lens (distinct from `contact`'s policy/first-contact framing). |
| `rhetoric` | Discourse / framing analysis. |

### Domain-specific

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `aviation` | General aviation (military or civil). |
| `commercial-aviation` | Commercial / airline operations. |

| `archive` | Archival project framing. |
| `taxonomy` | This page or pages about taxonomy. |

## Type Tags

The "what kind of page is this" axis. Most pages are sufficiently typed by their `category:` frontmatter and folder, so type tags are sparse.

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|

| `sighting` | A specific dated/located UAP observation (references/sighting-*). |
| `primary-source` | Pages built directly from a declassified document. |
| `declassified` | Source was formally declassified (often pairs with `primary-source`). |
| `witness` | Witness-testimony framing or analysis. |
| `intel-witness` | Intelligence-community witness specifically (subtype of `witness`). |
| `person` | Person entity (entities/ pages — usually redundant with category, but kept for graph clarity). |
| `organization` | Organization entity (entities/ pages). |
| `location` | Location entity. |
| `drone-pilot` | Drone-pilot witness role. |

## Metadata Tags

Operational / quality flags.

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `ambiguous` | Source/identification ambiguity in the page. |
| `ocr` | OCR-related issues or evidence noted on the page. |

## Migration Guide — Aliases

Tags below are **non-canonical**. Replace with the canonical form when found.

| Alias (old) | Canonical (new) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `military-org` | `military` | "Org" is implied by category=entities; consolidating military-domain tags. |
| `military-unit` | `military` | Same — units fold into `military`. |
| `diplomatic` | `diplomacy` | Use the noun form consistently. |
| `federal` | *(drop)* | Redundant alongside `state-department` + `organization` or `federal-le`. |

## Frequency Reference (post-normalization)

**As of 2026-05-10 batch-4 audit:** 107 unique tags across 260 wiki pages (41 sources / 256 manifest pages + 4 infrastructure). Equilibrium holds — zero alias usage, zero non-ASCII / whitespace / case / underscore issues, zero pages over the 5-tag limit, zero normalizations applied. One genuinely novel tag accepted this batch: `eti-attribution` (24 pages, broadly distributed). Top tags:

```
235 uap                74 primary-source      65 sighting           59 person
44 fbi                 40 nasa                40 history            36 declassified
35 witness             31 organization        29 1948               29 1947
29 intelligence        28 astronaut           28 usaf               27 policy
17 morphology          16 1950                16 civilian-research  15 state-department
14 ww2                 14 pattern             13 aviation           13 rhetoric
10 1949                10 federal-le           9 military            9 france
 8 diplomacy            7 california           7 usaaf               7 spacecraft
```

Notable shifts from batch-3 audit:

- `fbi` jumped from **10 → 44** — the batch-4 signature, driven by FBI HQ 62-83894 sections/serials and FBI field-office files.
- `primary-source` 43 → 74, `declassified` 22 → 36, `sighting` 46 → 65 — all reflect the FBI HQ ingest's mass of declassified field reports.
- `eti-attribution` newly canonicalized at 24 pages — concept that crystallized across this batch's contactee-movement and ETI-discourse work.
- `rhetoric` 0 → 13 — emerged with the figurative/discourse-analysis pages from this batch.
- `1950`, `1949`, `1952`, `1957`–`1958`, `1964`–`1969`, `1972`–`1973`, `1985`, `1940s`, `1950s` all instantiations of the documented `1947 … 1994` year-tag pattern. Not new tags.

The long tail (1–4 uses) remains dominated by year tags, US state tags, and country tags — narrow but uniformly applied. Acceptable.

**Canonical-but-unused tags** (zero pages): `georgia`, `nevada`, `meta`, `balls-of-fire`, `flying-discs`. `georgia` retained for future Russia-Georgia content. `nevada` retained as standard US-state slot. `meta` is implicit via folder placement. `balls-of-fire` and `flying-discs` retained as collective-noun morphology slots.

## Adding a New Tag

Before adding a tag:

1. Search this file — does an existing canonical tag cover it?
2. Search the corpus — has anyone already used a related tag form?
3. If genuinely new, place it in the right axis above and add a one-line description.
4. If you're introducing it on a single page only, prefer to omit; add only when it'll see ≥ 2 uses.
